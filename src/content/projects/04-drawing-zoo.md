Drawing Zoo is a relaxed, collaborative drawing game. It isn’t about skill or winning – just doodling together and having fun. The game is currently in play testing as we refine the rules and board design. It supports one to six players and works for a wide range of ages. Our plan is to produce an inexpensive, portable dry-erase board that’s easy to bring to parties or take traveling. Once the design is final, we’ll launch a crowdfunding campaign.
