Roxy is a fast, open-source Playdate game engine built for developers wanting solid performance and practical features. **It’s in pre-release, and the API is still changing, so it’s not ready for production yet.** Roxy includes C-level optimizations, asset pooling and caching, scene stacking and transitions, a flexible camera with parallax, sprite and actor systems with state machines, particle emitters, and support for orthogonal, isometric, and staggered isometric tilemaps. We’re using Roxy in our own Playdate project. Roxy is free under the MIT License.
